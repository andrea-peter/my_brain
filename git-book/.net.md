# .NET

There is a .NET SDK and a .NET runtime

## General



{% hint style="danger" %}
Warning, confusion ahead
{% endhint %}

* .NET
* .NET Framework
* .NET Standard

### .NET Framework

{% hint style="info" %}
To create a .NET Framework project with Visual Studio you must explicitly select a ".NET Framework" type project
{% endhint %}

An old technology that is not developed any more, but it is still supported by MS.&#x20;

Version 4.8.1 is the final one

### .NET 8

## Assemblies

An assembly...

* is a fundamental unit of deployment, `.dll` or `.exe`&#x20;
* can contain one or more modules

## .NET Versioning

### .NET runtime versioning

Semantic version

### .NET SDK versioning

The SDK version is aligned with the max runtime version it supports

`<runtime_major>.<runtime_minor>.<sdk_minor * 100 + sdk_patch>`

The SDK can create applications for its runtime or any lower version

* The Runtime and SDK share major and minor versions. The first two numbers for a given SDK and runtime should match. All the preceding examples are part of the .NET 5.0 release stream.
* The patch version of the runtime revs only when the runtime is updated. The SDK patch number doesn't update for a runtime patch.
* The patch version of the SDK updates only when the SDK is updated. It's possible that a runtime patch doesn't require an SDK patch.
